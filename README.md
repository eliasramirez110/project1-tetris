Project 1
Tetris
For my project 1, I would like to build a tetris game inspired by Pete's class on the canvas element, and the fact that it was one of my favorite games growing up. 

The objective of the game is to move falling shapes to form complete rows at the bottom of the game area. 
  A stretch goal would be to create a functionality that allows the user to rotate shapes.
For the mvp, the shapes will be squares and rectangles.
  strech goal would be to create shapes with more complex geometric features.
The user's goal is to create as many complete lines as possible within the time permitted. An untimed version of this game could also be created. 
  stretch goal could be having a user play against an AI. 

  technologies used to create my game
  As previously stated this game uses canvas to create shapes and movement of shapes.
  Each shape will be created as an object and/or class in JS and be given apporpriate properties. 
  I might use an API to use a variety of shapes, if I can find such an API.
